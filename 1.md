### 1. Introduction

Python is a widely used, general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn, read, and write.

* Popular among researchers and developers for its simplicity and readability
* Used by major deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch)
* Supported by an active open-source community and a vast ecosystem of libraries


#### ▷ How Python works

Python is an interpreted language. Here's a simplified view of what happens when you run Python code:

1. Your code (saved as `.py`) is first interpreted into bytecode (e.g., `.pyc` files).
2. This bytecode is then executed by a Python Virtual Machine (VM).
3. Most Python implementations (like CPython) are written in C, which ultimately translates instructions into machine code.

#### ▷ Python is strongly typed

Python keeps track of the type of each variable and does not automatically convert between types unless explicitly told to.
* The interpreter respects types and will raise errors if you use variables in incompatible ways.
* You can read more about variable types [here](.2.md).

#### ▷ Tools to run Python code

Before jumping into text processing, let’s warm up using the Python interpreter. While Python comes with a basic interface called IDLE, you might prefer more powerful tools:

##### IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

* Lightweight but powerful code editor
* Supports Python through extensions
* Integrated terminal, code linting, debugging, and version control

##### Notebook environment: Google Colab 

* Browser-based, no installation needed
* Built on Jupyter notebooks (*interactive*)
* Comes pre-loaded with many popular Python libraries
* Supports GPU acceleration
* Easily integrates with Google Drive

### 2. Installation: Python3

1. Download installer
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/   
   - Click “Download Python 3.x.x” for your OS.

2. Run installer
   - Windows:  
     - Double-click the `.exe`  
     - Check “Add Python to PATH”  
     - Click Install Now 
   - macOS:  
     - Open the downloaded `.pkg`  
     - Follow the on-screen prompts  

3. Verify installation
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   python3 -v
   python3 -vv
   ```

#### ▷ Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download VS Code

   * Visit [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   * Click Download for your platform.

2. Run installer

   * Windows: launch the `.exe` and follow defaults
   * macOS: drag Visual Studio Code.app to /Applications

3. Open VS Code

   * Launch the app from your Start Menu / Applications folder / launcher.

4. Install Python extension

   * Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
   * Search for Python (by Microsoft)
   * Click Install

5. Verify in integrated terminal

   * Open the built-in terminal (Ctrl+\`)
   * Run:

     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

### 3. Three ways to run code

#### ▷ Example: Python as a Calculator  
You'll see how Python can serve as a quick interactive calculator for arithmetic operations.

```python
>>> 1 + 5 * 2 - 3
8
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
20
>>> 1.0 / 3.0
0.3333333333333333
````

You can execute these operations in three ways:

1. Interactive terminal

   ```bash
   $ python3
   >>> 1 + 5 * 2 - 3
   8
   ```
2. Script file

   ```bash
   # calculator.py
   print(1 + 5 * 2 - 3)
   $ python3 calculator.py
   # → Hello, World!
   ```
3. IDE or Notebook

   * a VSCode Python file with the built-in terminal or Python extension
   * a Colab notebook cell

### 4. Environment management
Managing your Python environment is important, especially when working on multiple projects with different requirements.

| Problem                                                                 | Solution                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple versions of Python may be needed                                 | Create isolated environments with different Python versions                 |
| Countless Python packages and dependencies                                | Manage dependencies within separate environments                            |
| Different projects require different (even conflicting) package versions | Use *virtual environments* to keep project-specific packages and versions     |
| Version conflicts can break code                                          | Avoid conflicts by isolating environments per project                       |
| Hard to share or reproduce setups                                         | Virtual environments make it easy to replicate and share environments       |

#### ▷ Solution 1: `venv`
- `venv` is the built-in tool in Python for creating virtual environments ([Python Docs: venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)).

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

* This creates a new virtual environment in a folder named `myenv`.
* That folder is the environment — you can choose any name you like.
* The environment is based on your current Python installation (called the "base").
* The created directory includes:

  * A Python interpreter
  * Standard libraries
  * Scripts and binaries specific to that environment
* Completely isolated from global or system-installed packages

To activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux), run the following from the directory where the environment was created:

  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```
To deactivate the environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

#### ▷ Solution 2: Anaconda / Miniconda

*Conda* is a widely used package and environment manager.

* Manages both Python and non-Python dependencies
* Can create and manage isolated environments


To create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
```

To activate/deactivate the environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
conda deactivate
```

To export environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
$ conda env export > environment.yml
```

#### ▷ Installing packagges

#### Using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -n myenv package_name
# Optional: specify version
conda install -n myenv package_name=1.2.3
```

#### Using `pip` in a Conda environment:

Sometimes a package isn't available via `conda`. In that case, activate your conda environment and use:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

> Tip: Install as many packages as possible using `conda` first. Use `pip` only for packages not available through `conda`, to avoid dependency issues.
