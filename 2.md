### 1. Values

Python has several basic types of values. The most common include:

* Strings (text)
* Integers (whole numbers)
* Floats (decimal numbers)
* Booleans (`True` and `False`)
* None (represents “no value”)

#### ▷ Strings  
Strings are sequences of characters interpreted as text. They are enclosed in single or double quotes:

```python
s1 = "Hello, world!"
s2 = 'Rock & Roll'
```

* Arithmetic with strings?

  ```python
  "9" + "3"      # → "93"
  "9" + 3        # TypeError: can’t add str and int
  ```
* Common string operations

  ```python
  # Concatenation
  "Hello, " + "Python!"     # → "Hello, Python!"

  # Length
  len("NLTK")               # → 4

  # Indexing
  s = "Python"
  s[0]                      # → "P"
  s[-1]                     # → "n"
  ```
#### Integers

Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point:

```python
i1 = 1
i2 = 42
i3 = -7
```

* Basic arithmetic

  ```python
  i1 + i2                   # → 43
  i2 - 10                   # → 32
  i3 * 3                    # → -21

  # Division in Python 3
  7 / 2                     # → 3.5   # true division
  7 // 2                    # → 3     # floor division
  ```

#### ▷ Floats

Floats are numbers with decimal places:

```python
f1 = 1.234
f2 = 2.0
f3 = -6.789
```

* Mixing ints and floats

  ```python
  3 + 0.5                   # → 3.5
  7 / 2                     # → 3.5
  ```

#### ▷ Booleans

Booleans represent truth values: `True` or `False`.

```python
is_hungry = True
is_sleepy = False
```

* Used in comparison

```python
5 > 3        # → True
2 == 4       # → False
```
* More about comparison operators

| Operator             | Meaning                       | Example  | Result |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `==`                 | Equal to                      | `2 == 2` | `True` |
| `!=`                 | Not equal to                  | `3 != 4` | `True` |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Less than, greater than, etc. | `5 >= 2` | `True` |

**Example with `!=`:**

```python
if [] != [None]:
    print("These are different")
# Output: These are different
```


* Boolean logical operators:

| Operator | Description                      | Example          | Result  |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `and`    | True if both are True        | `True and False` | `False` |
| `or`     | True if at least one is True | `True or False`  | `True`  |
| `not`    | Reverses the Boolean value       | `not True`       | `False` |

```python
x = True
y = False

x and y       # → False
x or y        # → True
not x         # → False
```

#### ▷ None

`None` is a special value that means “no value” or “nothing.” It’s often used as a default or placeholder.

```python
result = None
print(result)        # → None
```

### 2. Variables

Variables store values of any type. Assignment is straightforward:

```python
a = "this is a string"
b = 9
c = 3.2

print(b + c)                # → 12.2
```

* **Reassignment**

  ```python
  a = a + "!"
  print(a)                   # → "this is a string!"
  ```

---

### 3. Functions

Functions perform operations on values or objects. Common ones include:

| Function   | Description                              | Example              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `print(x)` | Display `x` in the console               | `print("Hi!")` → Hi! |
| `len(x)`   | Return length of a string or list        | `len("abc")` → 3     |
| `str(x)`   | Convert `x` to a string                  | `str(16)` → `"16"`   |
| `int(x)`   | Convert to integer (floats rounded down) | `int(3.9)` → 3       |
| `float(x)` | Convert to float                         | `float("2.5")` → 2.5 |

---

### 4. Methods

Methods are functions bound to objects (typically defined inside a class). For strings:

```python
sample = "This is a STRING"
```

* `.lower()`

  ```python
  sample.lower()            # → "this is a string"
  ```

* `.split(sep)`

  ```python
  sample.lower().split(" ")
  # → ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
  ```

* Splitting on another character

  ```python
  "banana".split("a")       # → ['', 'b', 'n', 'n', '']
  ```  

* Combining functions & methods

Chain calls for concise code:

```python
# Lowercase, split into words, and count them
len("This is a STRING".lower().split())   # → 4
```

### 5. Exercises

   string_sent = "Rock climbing and conducting corpus analyses in Python are my favorite activities."
   ```
2. Count characters

   ```python
   print(len(string_sent))
   ```

   ```python
   list_sent = string_sent.split(" ")
   print(list_sent)
   ```

5. Average characters per word

   ```python
   av_chars = len(string_sent) / len(list_sent)
   ```
