### 1. Tuples

A tuple is like a list but immutable—once created, you cannot change its elements:

```python
# Create and concatenate
t = (1, 2)
t = t + (3, 4)
print(t)                 # → (1, 2, 3, 4)

# Indexing and slicing
print(t[0])              # → 1
print(t[-1])             # → 4
print(t[1:3])            # → (2, 3)

# Unpacking
x, y, *rest = t
print(x, y, rest)        # → 1 2 [3, 4]
```

> **Use cases:** fixed configuration values, returning multiple values from functions, unpacking.

### 2. Dictionaries

A dictionary stores values indexed by unique keys (instead of by position):

```python
# Create a dictionary of word frequencies
freq = {
    "the": 69033,
    "of":  36998,
    "and": 30157
}

# Lookup by key
print(freq["the"])        # → 69033

# Add or update entries
freq["to"] = 21892
freq["and"] = 30500       # overwrite old value

# Remove an entry
del freq["of"]
```

#### ▷ Common methods

Looping over a dictionary yields its keys; We use `.values()` and `.items()` for values and (key, value) pairs:

* `dict.keys()` → iterable of keys
* `dict.values()` → iterable of values
* `dict.items()` → iterable of `(key, value)` tuples
* `dict.get(key, default)` → returns the value for a key, or default if the key is missing

```python
for word in freq:                      
    print(word)      # Prints each key: "the", "and", "to"

for count in freq.values():   
    print(count)      # Prints each value: 69033, 30500, 21892

for word, count in freq.items():      
    print(f"{word}: {count}")   
print(freq.get("of", 0))    
```

### 3. More about functions

We learned function [here](2.md/#3-functions). Functions help you **DRY** (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”) your code. They take arguments and may return values.

In addition to regular functions defined with `def`, Python also supports `lambda` functions, which are small anonymous functions defined in a single line. These are useful for short operations—especially when used with functions like `map`(), `filter`(), or `sorted`().

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting for the given name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))     # → "Hello, Alice!"
```

#### ▷ Safe division

Avoid `ZeroDivisionError` by checking the denominator:

```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    """Divide a by b; return None if b is zero."""
    if b == 0:
        return None
    return a / b

print(safe_divide(10, 2))  # → 5.0
print(safe_divide(10, 0))  # → None
```

#### ▷ Palindrome checker

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """Return True if s reads the same forwards and backwards."""
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]

print(is_palindrome("Race car"))  # → True
print(is_palindrome("Python"))    # → False
```

#### ▷ Higher-order functions and lambdas

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]                      

squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))   # lambda x: x**2 defines an anonymous function that squares x; map() applies that function to every element in 'nums'

print(squares)   # → [1, 4, 9, 16]                           
```

### 4. Classes

Functions let you group actions. Classes let you group both data and behaviors together. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects (instances) that have certain properties and can do certain things.

```python
class Animal(object):                        # Define a class named Animal
    def __init__(self, species, age):       # Constructor: runs when you create an object
        self.species = species              # Instance variable
        self.age = age

    def is_person(self):                    # Method: like a function, but for the class
        return self.species

    def age_one_year(self):                 # Behavior: increase age by 1
        self.age += 1
```

You can also create a new class based on an existing one. This is called inheritance.

```python
class Dog(Animal):                          # Dog inherits from Animal
    def age_one_year(self):                 # Overrides the method from Animal
        self.age += 7
```

#### ▷ Simple test

```python
a = Animal("Human", 5)
d = Dog("Dog", 5)

a.age_one_year()
d.age_one_year()

print(a.age)     # → 6 
print(d.age)     # → 12 
```

### 5. Working with files 

In text data processing, you often need to save data to a file or read it back later. Python provides simple tools to handle plain text, CSV, and JSON formats.

#### ▷ Write a file

```python
data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

with open("fruits.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for fruit in data:
        f.write(fruit + "\n")
```

#### ▷ Read from a text file

```python
with open("fruits.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
print(lines)                    
# → ['apple\n', 'banana\n', 'cherry\n']
```

#### ▷ Handling a CSV file

```python
import csv

# Write CSV
with open("counts.csv", "w", newline="") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(["word","count"])
    for w, c in freq.items():
        writer.writerow([w, c])

# Read CSV into a dictionary
counts = {}
with open("counts.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        counts[row["word"]] = int(row["count"])
print(counts)
```

### ▷ Handling a JSON file

```python
import json

# Dump to JSON
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(freq, f, indent=2)

# Load from JSON
with open("data.json") as f:
    loaded = json.load(f)
print(loaded)
```

### 6. Exercises

1. Phonebook dictionary

   * Create a dict `phonebook` mapping names to phone numbers.
   * Add, update, delete entries.
   * Print all entries in the format `"Name: Number"`.

2. Tuple wwapping

   * Given `a, b = 5, 10`, swap their values in one line using tuple unpacking.
   * Print `a` and `b` after swapping.

3. Function composition

   * Write a function `apply_and_sum(func, lst)` that applies `func` to each element of `lst` and returns the sum of results.
   * Test with `func=lambda x: x*2` and `lst=[1,2,3]`.

4. Line counter

   * Write `count_lines(filename)` that returns the number of non-blank lines in a text file.
   * Use it on a sample `.txt` you create.

5. CSV to JSON Converter

   * Write `csv_to_json(csv_file, json_file)` that reads `csv_file` (with headers) into a list of dicts and writes it as JSON to `json_file`.
   * Verify by loading the JSON and printing the first record.
